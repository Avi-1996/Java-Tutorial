Multiple inheritance is not possible in Java:

6.Destructors are required in C++, but, Destructors are not required in JAVA:
	Create Objects----> Constructors
	Destroy object----> Destructors

java has provided one inbuiklt feature name garbage collector ...so devloper does not responsible top destroy object
1.C and C++ are static programming languages but JAVA is dynamic programming language:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any programming language allows memory allocation for primitive data types at compilation time
[Static Time] then that programming language is called as Static Programming language.
EX: C and C++
.
In C and C++ applications, memory will be allocated for primitive data types at compilation time only,
not at runtime.

If any programming language allows memory allocation for primitive data types at runtime, not at
compilation time then that programming language is called as Dynamic Programming Language.
EX: JAVA
In java applications, memory will be allocated for primitive data types at runtime only, not at
compilation time.

Note: In Java applications, memory will be allocated for primitive data types at the time of creating
objects only, in java applications, objects are created at runtime only.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.Pre-Processor is required in C and C++ , but, Pre-Processor is not required in Java:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case of C and C++, the complete predefined library is provided in the form of header files

EX:
stdio.h
conio.h
math.h
---
----
If we want to use predefined library in C and C++ applications, we have to include header files in C
and C++ applications, for this, we have to use #include<> statement.

EX:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<math.h>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.C and C++ are platform dependent programming languages, but, JAVA is platform Independent
programming language:
Q)What are the differences between .exe file and .class file?
Ans:
1. .exe file is available upto C and C++ only.
 .class file is available upto Java.

2. .exe file contains directly executable code.
 .class file contains bytecode, it is not executable code directly, it is an intermediate code.

3. .exe file is platform dependent file.
 .class file is platform independent file.

4. .exe file is less secured file.
 .class file is more secured file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.Pointers are existed in C and C++, but, Pointers are not existed in Java:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q)What are the differences between pointer variables and referece variables?
Ans:
1. Pointer variables are available upto C and C++.
 Reference variables are available upto JAVA mainly.

2. Pointer variables are able to refer a block of memory by storing its address locations.
 Reference variables are able to refer a block of memory[Object] by storing object reference values,

where Object reference value is hexa decimal form of hashcode, where hashcode is an unique
identity provided by Heap manager.

3. Pointer variables are recognized and initialized at compilation time.

4. Reference variables are recognized and initialized at runtime.

5.Multiple inheritance is not possible in Java:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. oprator overloading is not avail bale in JAVA:
----------------------------------------------------
Polymorphism:
Static Polymorphism
Ex-: Overloadind

Dynamic Polymorphimsm
Ex-:Ovewrriding


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.c&c++ following call by value call by refrence parameter passing machanism JAVA is following only call by value passing machanism

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.in c & c++ integer are ablwe to take 2 byte of memoryu and char take 1 byte of memmorybut in java inetger take 4 byte and char 2 byte:
